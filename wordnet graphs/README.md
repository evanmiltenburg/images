# Wordnet graphs
---
These graphs show the concreteness of nouns in WordNet. Each file represents a separate lexname. **Concrete** nouns have links in **yellow**, while **abstract** nouns have links in **red**. These visualizations were made using Python and d3.js.

### Some observations
- Lexname can be a strong indicator for the abstractness/concreteness of the nouns.
- Branches usually become more concrete towards the leaf nodes.
- There are often 'concrete branches' and 'abstract branches'.

**Comments on the interpretation of these graphs are very welcome!**
